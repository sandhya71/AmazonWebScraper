- Handles pagination for scraping multiple pages of search results or product listings
- Stores scraped data to a file or database for further analysis
- Implements techniques to bypass anti-scraping measures, such as rate limiting and CAPTCHAs
- Respects Amazon's robots.txt file and follows guidelines for web scraping

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).
3. Run the `amazon_scraper.py` script, providing the necessary parameters (e.g., search query, category) as arguments.

**Notes:**
- Be sure to use the scraper responsibly and ethically, respecting Amazon's terms of service and guidelines for web scraping.
- Regularly monitor and update the scraper to ensure it continues to function correctly as Amazon's website evolves.
